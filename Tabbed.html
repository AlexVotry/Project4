						<h2>Where I'm from</h2>
						<p>I was born on a marine base in Cherry Point North Carolina. We moved several times until second grade when we made our
						home in Oak Harbor, Washington.  In 7th grade my dad bought a TRS80 home computer from Radio Shack.  I learned a little 
						Basic programming, enough to move some sprites around and shoot each other.</p>

						<p>I moved to Seattle to go to the University of Washington.  I couldn't decide what I wanted to do, and took classes
						in every subject I could think of.  I finished with a BA in psychology and still no plans.</p>

						<p>I bought a one-way ticket to Japan and found a job coaching international corporations in American 
						culture and language.</p>

						<p>After 3 years I came back and went back to UW to complete my third year of Japanese. During this time I met
						the love of my life and convinced her to marry me.  From there, I learned a trade, became a master plumber
						and started my own business, which I ran for over 15 years.</p>

						<p>During the last 5 years I found I wasn't enjoying what I was doing.  I spent time exploring
						what I enjoy doing, and found programing was what I enjoyed doing most.  I would write dynamic spread sheets to
						figure out various data.  I finished a couple on line courses in Excell, but I wanted to do more.</p>

						<h2>Current</h2>

						<p>My wife, Kim and I are still together. We raised two wonderful children, my son has his own family now, and my daughter
						recently graduated high school as a National Merit Society member.  </p>

						<p>During the last 5 years I found I wasn't enjoying my job.  I spent time exploring
						what I enjoy doing, and found programing was what I enjoyed doing most.  I would write dynamic spread sheets to
						figure out various data.  I finished a couple on line courses in Excell, but I wanted to do more.</p>

						<p>I am currently enrolled in the Web Developement program through EDCC. I sold my business this summer and have begun
						working through the classes full time.  I am really enjoying spending full days at the computer and working through
						the puzzles programming can provide.</p>

			  	<h3>Racing</h3>
				  <div id="racing">
				  	<div  id="sidebar">
					    <p>I love racing bicycles.  I’ve been at it for about five years. The last two years I’ve been riding with the Therapeutic  Associates Incorporated.  </p>
					    <p> It’s nice to ride with a team to help stay motivated, and the sponsorship covers a lot of the costs in racing.  I ride from 400 to 700 miles per month training and racing.  I race in three different bicycle disciplines:</p>
				    </div>
				    <div id='main'>
				    	<a><ul class="bicycle">Road</a>
					      	<li>  Road racing starts in February and finishes in July. My road races are on Saturday or Sunday and usually about 60 to 70 miles.  The peloton is usually around 40 to 60 riders, so riding shoulder to shoulder is pretty common.</li>
					      	<li>
					      	<a class="racing" rel="gallery1" href="images/road.jpg" title="Racing at Volunteer Park"><img class="small" src="images/road.jpg" alt='road racing'/></a>

					      	<a class="racing" rel="gallery1" href="images/PRsprint.jpg" title="Sprinting at S.I.R."><img class="small" src="images/PRsprint.jpg" alt='final sprint'/></a>

					      	<a class="racing" rel="gallery1" href="images/wheelRepair.jpg" title="Repairing a wheel on a training ride"><img class="small" src="images/wheelRepair.jpg" alt='wheel repair'/></a>
					      	</li>
					    </ul>
					    <a><ul class="bicycle">Track</a>
					      		<li>Track starts in June and ends in September.  The track is in Marymoor Park in Redmond.  Track bikes don’t have any brakes and are a fixed gear.Track has been the most fun over the last few years.  I have upgraded to the elite division in racing and have had a lot of success recently.</li>
					      		<li>
					      		<a class="fancybox-thumb" rel="fancybox-thumb" href="images/track.jpg" title="Enjoying the Leader's Jersey"><img class="small" src="images/track.jpg" alt="track" /></a>

					      		</li>
						</ul>
						<a><ul class="bicycle">Cyclocross</a>
					      		<li>Cyclocross starts in August and ends in January.  Cyclocross is a cross between road racing and mountain bike racing.  We get racers from both disciplines in the race.  It reminds me a bit like a steeplechase since we often have to dismount and jump over barriers or run up steep banks.</li>
					      		<li><a class="cross" rel="fancybox-thumb" href="images/cross.jpg" title="Through dirt"><img class="small" src="images/cross.jpg" alt="track" /></a>

					      		<a class="cross" rel="fancybox-thumb" href="images/sand.jpg" title="Across the sand"><img class="small" src="images/sand.jpg" alt="track" /></a>

					  	<h3>Woodworking</h3>						  
				 	<div id="woodworking">
						    <p>Woodworking has been a minor interest of mine.  I like making small wooden objects and giving them as gifts.  It has been a nice creative outlet.  I haven’t kept many and didn’t think to take pictures, but I do have a couple examples.</p>
						  <div class="wood">
						  	<p> This is a wood relief of a manala for my wife and I.  She made a more elaborate painting, but I thought it would be fun to create a little depth to it.</p>
						  	<a class="single" href="images/mandala.jpg" title="Mandala"><img class="small" src="images/mandala.jpg" alt="mandala" />
						  </div>
						  <div id="main">
						  	<p> I made this for my daughter when she turned 10.  It's a wand with case.  (She was <i>really</i> into Harry Potter!)</p>
						  	<a class="single" href="images/closedWand.jpg" title="Wand case"><img class="small" src="images/closedWand.jpg" alt="wand case" /></a>
						  	<a class="single" href="images/openWand.jpg" title="Wand case"><img class="small" src="images/openWand.jpg" alt="wand case" /></a>
						  </div>
					</div>
					  	<h3>Cabinet making</h3>
					<div id="cabinet">
				    	    <p>I also enjoy cabinet making.  Most of this I’ve kept for our house.  The nice thing about making your own furniture, is that you can make it precisely the way you want it.</p>
